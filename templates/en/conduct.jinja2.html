    <h2>Code of conduct</h2>

    <p>
      As an event organised by the Francophone Python Association
      (AFPy), <a href="https://www.afpy.org/docs/charte">the code of conduct
      carried</a> by the association does apply.
    </p>
    <p>
      The goal of AFPy is to promote the Python programming language among the
      widest possible audience. We diffuse our knowledge and are open to
      external contributions because diversity, mutual attention, solidarity
      and democracy increase the potential of AFPy and each one of its
      members. That’s why we encourage the participation of all members of the
      Python community, or wishing to be part of it, in any event we
      (co-)organize. AFPy wishes anyone interested to be welcome in a pleasant
      and meaningful way.
    </p>
    <p>
      AFPy therefore expects each member of the association to show respect and
      courtesy toward other members of the association and people met during
      any event organized by the association.
    </p>
    <p>
      This text is inspired by the code of conduct established by the Ada
      Initiative and by the French anti-discrimination law.
    </p>

    <section>
      <h3>The "Short" Version</h3>
      <p>
        AFPy wishes to avoid any type of discrimination, whether based on
        gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, origin or
        religion, and in any form whatsoever (speech, image, text and
        other). Of course, this is not an exhaustive list.
      </p>

      <p>
        Although AFPy aims to promote Python in the French-speaking world, the
        association is committed to welcome everyone, whatever their
        programming language or mother tongue.
      </p>

      <p>
        AFPy expects from its members a language and a style adapted to a
        diverse audience. Sexual or racist allusions are in no way tolerated,
        whatever their medium.
      </p>

      <p>
        Be polite. Don’t insult anyone. Discrimination and harassment are to be
        excluded in writing, visuals, words and actions, whatever their nature
        (sexual, racist, religious, social…).
      </p>

      <p>
        Disrespecting these good manners may lead to the exclusion from the
        event, at the sole discretion of one or more organizers, or the
        association, after deliberation of the executive committee, as well as
        from any service proposed by AFPy (planet AFPy, blog, IRC channels).
      </p>
    </section>

      <h3>The "Long" Version</h3>

      <h4>Scope</h4>
      <p>
        These good practices apply within the framework of any event
        (co-)organized by AFPy in a direct or indirect way, namely:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>conferences (PyConFr and other),</li>
        <li>IRC, XMPP or other instant messaging channels,</li>
        <li>planet AFPy,</li>
        <li>AFPy blogs,</li>
        <li>mailing lists,</li>
        <li>any event where you represent AFPy, including casual meetings.</li>
      </ul>

      <h4>Definition of Discrimination</h4>
      <p>
        Discrimination includes, according to French law, “the situation in
        which, on the basis of their belonging or not belonging, real or
        supposed, to an ethnic group or race, their religion, their beliefs,
        their age, their disability, their sexual orientation or gender, a
        person is treated less favourably than an other is, has been or will be
        treated in a comparable situation.” “Any sexually connoted act,
        [suffered] by a person and having the object or effect of violating
        their dignity or creating an intimidating, hostile, degrading,
        humiliating or offensive environment” or “the act of ordering anyone to
        behave this way” is therefore prohibited.
      </p>

      <h4>Behaviors to Banish</h4>
      <p>
        According to the above definition, we invite you to refrain:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>any inappropriate expression or attitude,</li>
        <li>presenting sexual or shocking (especially violent) images,</li>
        <li>deliberate intimidation, harassment, improper and non-consensual physical contact.</li>
      </ul>

      <h4>Sensitivity</h4>
      <p>
        If you think that your communication may hurt your audience, because of
        the subject or some included images, please take the time to inform the
        people before talking, so that anyone can leave the room if they want
        to; you can anyway ask the organizers or the AFPy members to get advice.
      </p>

      <h4>Deal with Incidents</h4>
      <p>
        In case of harassment or discrimination due to a participant, the event
        organizers or the steering commitee members can take measures including
        a temporary or definitive exclusion.
